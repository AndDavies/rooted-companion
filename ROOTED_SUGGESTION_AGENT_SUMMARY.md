# ‚úÖ ROOTED Suggestion Agent - Implementation Complete

## What Was Built

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive LangChain-powered suggestion agent for the ROOTED Companion App that generates personalized wellness recommendations based on biometric data.

## üìÅ Files Created

### Core Implementation
- **`lib/llm/suggestionAgent.ts`** (13KB) - Main agent with LangChain + OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **`app/api/suggestions/daily/route.ts`** - API endpoint for daily suggestions  
- **`app/api/suggestions/complete/route.ts`** - API endpoint for marking completions

### Documentation & Examples
- **`lib/llm/README.md`** - Comprehensive usage documentation
- **`lib/llm/SETUP.md`** - Complete setup and troubleshooting guide
- **`lib/llm/example-usage.ts`** - Usage examples and React component templates

## üß† Core Function Implementation

### `generateDailySuggestion(userId: string): Promise<SuggestionPayload>`

**‚úÖ Input Behavior:**
1. **Loads recent biometric data** (24-48h) from `wearable_data` table
   - Queries: `hrv_rmssd`, `heart_rate_resting`, `sleep_total`, `stress_avg`
   - Uses proper joins through `wearable_connections` table
   - Handles missing data gracefully

2. **Calculates Recovery Score** (0-100) based on evidence-based ranges:
   - **HRV (30% weight)**: >50ms excellent, 30-50ms good, 20-30ms fair, <20ms poor
   - **RHR (25% weight)**: <60 excellent, 60-70 good, 70-80 average, >80 poor  
   - **Sleep (30% weight)**: 7-9h optimal, 6-10h good, 5-11h fair, else poor
   - **Stress (15% weight)**: 0-20 low, 20-40 moderate, 40-60 high, >60 very high

3. **Fallback handling**: Returns `suggestBreathwork()` when no biometric data

4. **LangChain Integration**:
   - Uses **ChatOpenAI** with **GPT-4o-mini** 
   - Soft-spoken, evidence-based wellness coach persona ("ROOTED")
   - Structured JSON output with action, category, and rationale
   - Error handling with graceful fallbacks

5. **Database Integration**:
   - Automatically inserts suggestions into `suggestion_logs` table
   - Uses Supabase admin client for service-level operations
   - Handles all database errors gracefully

**‚úÖ Output:**
```typescript
type SuggestionPayload = {
  action: string;           // "10-minute forest walk"
  category: 'movement' | 'breathwork' | 'mindset' | 'sleep' | 'nutrition';
  rationale: string;        // Evidence-based explanation
  recoveryScore: number;    // 0-100 calculated score
  wearableUsed: boolean;    // Whether biometric data was available
}
```

## üõ† Additional Features Implemented

### Helper Functions
- **`getLatestBiometrics(userId, metricType)`** - Get most recent metric value
- **`markSuggestionCompleted(suggestionId)`** - Mark suggestions as done
- **`getHRVTrend(userId, days)`** - Analyze HRV trends over time
- **`calculateRecoveryScore(data)`** - Evidence-based scoring algorithm

### API Endpoints
- **`POST /api/suggestions/daily`** - Generate or fetch today's suggestion
- **`GET /api/suggestions/daily`** - Get existing suggestion or generate new one  
- **`POST /api/suggestions/complete`** - Mark suggestion as completed
- **`GET /api/suggestions/complete`** - Get completion statistics and streaks

### Error Handling & Fallbacks
- **No biometric data**: Returns breathwork fallback
- **OpenAI API failure**: Returns movement-based fallback  
- **JSON parsing errors**: Returns formatted fallback suggestion
- **Database errors**: Continues with graceful degradation
- **Authentication errors**: Proper 401/403 responses

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies Added
```bash
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core langchain
```

### Database Schema Used
- **`wearable_data`** ‚Üî **`wearable_connections`** ‚Üî **`auth.users`**
- **`suggestion_logs`** - Stores generated suggestions with metadata
- **`mood_reflections`** - Optional mood check-ins after suggestions

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url  
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### Authentication & Security
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints validate user authentication
- ‚úÖ Users can only access their own suggestions  
- ‚úÖ Uses Supabase admin client with proper RLS
- ‚úÖ No identifying user data sent to OpenAI
- ‚úÖ Secure environment variable handling

## üéØ ROOTED AI Coaching Persona

The agent embodies "ROOTED" - a wellness coach that is:
- **Soft-spoken & supportive**: Never overwhelming or pushy
- **Evidence-based**: Grounded in wellness research  
- **Actionable**: Specific 5-20 minute suggestions
- **Personalized**: Tailored to individual biometric patterns
- **Safe**: Never provides medical advice

### Example Suggestions by Category
- **Movement**: "Take a 10-minute forest walk"
- **Breathwork**: "Practice 4-7-8 breathing for 5 minutes"  
- **Mindset**: "Write down 3 things you're grateful for"
- **Sleep**: "Start your wind-down routine 30 minutes earlier"
- **Nutrition**: "Have a mindful cup of herbal tea"

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Server Action (Recommended)
```typescript
import { generateDailySuggestion } from '@/lib/llm/suggestionAgent';

const suggestion = await generateDailySuggestion(userId);
```

### API Call
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/suggestions/daily', { method: 'POST' });
const { suggestion } = await response.json();
```

### React Component Integration
See `lib/llm/example-usage.ts` for complete React component examples.

## üìä Sample Output

### With Biometric Data
```json
{
  "action": "Take a 15-minute walk in nature, focusing on deep belly breathing",
  "category": "movement", 
  "rationale": "Your HRV is showing signs of stress (32ms, trending down) and your sleep was shorter than optimal (6.2 hours). Gentle movement with fresh air will help rebalance your nervous system and prepare you for better rest tonight.",
  "recoveryScore": 68,
  "wearableUsed": true
}
```

### Fallback (No Data)
```json
{
  "action": "Take 5 minutes for 4-7-8 breathing: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Repeat 4 cycles.",
  "category": "breathwork",
  "rationale": "Without biometric data to guide us today, let's focus on proven stress-reduction techniques. The 4-7-8 breathing pattern activates your parasympathetic nervous system, helping to naturally calm your mind and body.",
  "recoveryScore": 50,
  "wearableUsed": false
}
```
