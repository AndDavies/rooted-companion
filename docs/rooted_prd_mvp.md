# ROOTED Companion App â€” Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Summary

**The ROOTED Companion App** is a recovery-first wellness platform that helps users interpret their biometric signals (HRV, RHR, sleep, stress) and take one personalized, evidence-based action each day. It integrates wearable data when available, but gracefully falls back to reflective self-assessment. The app includes a quiet AI coach (not chatbot-first) and always retains a human-in-the-loop model with real facilitators.

This is not a tracker. This is a **rest-and-restore ally** built for high-functioning but burnt-out individuals.
